Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR enables small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. By including qualified small businesses in the nation\u2019s R&amp;D arena, high-tech innovation is stimulated and the United States gains entrepreneurial spirit as it meets its specific research and development needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2> <br><strong>About M4 Engineering<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2001, M4 Engineering is a collective of aerospace and structural engineers who provide crisis and preventive engineering analysis, research and development consultation. As we like to say, we\u2019re the engineers to call before it breaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We combine state-of-the-art software development with expertise in multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO). Together, we are able to save time and reduce the costs associated with the analysis of high performance structures typically found in aerospace, automotive, construction, theme park attractions, and energy production, including wind, oil, and coal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>M4 Engineering is proud to partner with the world\u2019s finest private, government, and global entities, including NASA, US Air Force, Boeing, GE, Hitco and many more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>M4 Engineering has offices in Long Beach, California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about M4, please visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/m4-engineering.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.m4-engineering.com\/<\/a>&nbsp;or follow us on Twitter&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitter.com\/m4engineering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@m4engineering<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>M4 Engineering has been selected by the DoD SBIR program for two Phase I awards.&nbsp; The topics are: AF131-005&nbsp;Innovative Propeller Multi-Point Multi-Disciplinary Optimization This proposal effort seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of developing and integrating a set of analysis modules into a multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) process in order to enhance propeller design and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"content-type":""},"categories":[12],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.6 -
