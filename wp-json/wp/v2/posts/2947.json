With M4SS, engineers have the ability to receive weight-related feedback as soon as the initial models are completed, shrinking the procedure for weight calculation to weeks or even hours.<\/p><p>\u201cThe number of designs you can explore is much larger, and the chances of finding a design that really works is much higher,\u201d Dr. Baker added.<\/p><p>Not only does M4 Engineering offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.m4-engineering.com\/m4ss\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">M4 Structures Studio<\/a> as a stand-alone product, but the company also utilizes the software in-house for its consulting business.
