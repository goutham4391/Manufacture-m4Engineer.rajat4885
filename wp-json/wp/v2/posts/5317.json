Air taxis also could shuttle riders between places like San Diego International Airport and such outlying cities as Oceanside and Escondido.<\/p><p>A \u201c90-minute ground commute to a downtown workplace could be reduced to a 15-minute air taxi flight,\u201d said John Hwang, a UCSD mechanical and aerospace engineering, said in a statement.<\/p><p>Hwang is leading the research team, which includes UCSD engineer Shirley Meng, one of the nation\u2019s foremost battery experts, as well as collaborators from San Diego State University, UC Davis, Brigham Young University, Aurora Flight Sciences and M4 Engineering.<\/p><p>Interest in UAM has waxed and waned over the years.
