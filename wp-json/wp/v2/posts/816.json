The company \u2014 which provides structural analysis, consulting and software development for aerospace firms \u2014 has leveraged a string of federal research grants into products and services it sells to clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>t has even spun off a small company, Modular Wind Energy Inc. of Huntington Beach, which uses M4\u2019s federally funded research to develop lighter and cheaper blades for wind turbines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat we have tried to do is take that money from the government and, sure, do good research for the problem the government is interested in, but also try to turn that into something much bigger, said Kevin Roughen, M4\u2019s vice president.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>M4, which has 20 employees, was started with the help of a federal grant in 2001.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning research into commercial products is a main goal of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. The federal programs spend about $2 billion a year on grants and contracts for scientific research and development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SBIR was established by law in 1982 to fund high-tech research at small businesses. STTR, a smaller program that requires a university research partner, began in 1992.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>California typically wins the largest chunk of money from the programs. Small businesses in the state won $402 million through 1,230 grants and contracts awarded in the government\u2019s fiscal 2009, according to the Small Business Administration\u2019s Technology Resources Network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Auritec Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Santa Monica said that without grants, it wouldn\u2019t have been able to fund data collection for the drug delivery method it developed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are starting to talk to big pharmaceutical companies about licensing our products,\u201d said Amanda Malone, vice president of Auritec, which has 15 employees. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have that data, I don\u2019t think anybody would be talking to us, and you can\u2019t get that kind of data without money.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the future of SBIR and STTR is uncertain. Not formally reauthorized by Congress for several years, they\u2019ve been limping along on extensions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt is nerve-racking,\u201d said Rick Shie, senior vice president of Physical Optics Corp. in Torrance, a frequent SBIR grant winner that develops and makes optical electronics for military and commercial use. Started 25 years ago under an SBIR grant, the firm now employs 180 people and has spun off six other companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the holdup in reauthorization is because of a battle over how much of the funds can go to venture capital-backed businesses. A House version of a funding bill would allow 35% to 45% of SBIR awards to go to businesses that are majority-owned by venture capitalists. The Senate version allows 15% to 25%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although most of the individual grants are relatively small \u2014 starting at about $150,000 for so-called Phase I awards \u2014 companies can apply for more than one at a time. Phase II awards, which are harder to get, can reach about $1 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all businesses have been happy with the programs. A frequently heard complaint is that the grant process takes too long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, there have been concerns about the potential for fraud \u2014 an SBIR program overseen byNASA was found, in an internal review, to not have \u201cappropriate internal controls.\u201d The review found that this left the door open to grant recipients receiving multiple awards for the same research, or making claims for costs that were not allowed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SBA is working on a set of initiatives to try to fix some of the security shortcomings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At their best, the programs provide small businesses with the chance to work on high-risk research that can produce big rewards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe own our own soul, and that\u2019s the point, because of SBIR you don\u2019t have to sell your soul\u201d to outside investors, Shie said. \u201cAnd you can retain your technology.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>smallbiz@latimes.com<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copyright \u00a9 2011, Los Angeles Times<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Cyndia Zwahlen for the Los Angeles Times May 2, 2011 M4 Engineering Inc., a small company in Long Beach, has figured out how to use tax dollars to prosper.
