The Vex Robotics program is a highly competitive international competition that challenges students to design and build multi-faceted locomotive robots that compete in a range of physical tasks for points. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/m4-engineering.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/CAMS-photo-press-release.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-831\" width=\"632\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.m4-engineering.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/CAMS-photo-press-release.png 632w, https:\/\/www.m4-engineering.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/CAMS-photo-press-release-300x187.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of this project is to renew M4\u2019s investment in STEM and the engineers of tomorrow. Beyond direct financial support M4 hopes to help the CAMS VEX Robotics teams in the following areas:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Enhancing Development of fundraising Skills<\/li><li>Teaching and Supporting Marketing and branding skills\/efforts<\/li><li>Preparing students readiness for the modern engineering workplace<\/li><li>Improving Critical Engineering\/Analytical skills<\/li><li>Foster a relationship with CAMS and its students<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan Abir and Joey Hanna from M4\u2019s sales and marketing group will be leading this effort as part of M4\u2019s ongoing community outreach and academic programs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Myles L. Baker, President, M4 Engineering commented on M4\u2019s decision to support CAMS: \u201c<em>M4 is always happy to support a school and program which so concretely contributes to the development of the future of our industry<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This support is critical for the club due to the financial demands placed on the teams for material and travel expenses. Previously, M4 spent time understanding the program and its needs, providing judging support at a local competition, and donating $1,000 as a goodwill gesture to aid in these efforts. This year, M4 plans to expand the scope of its support and provide the students guest lectures from M4 employees to teach the students critical marketing and fundraising skills to help their teams to compete in this year\u2019s competitions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nancy Brown teaches at CAMS and helps the students run the Vex Robotics club said: \u201c<em>M4 Engineering is a forward-thinking company that is improving tomorrow\u2019s technology by supporting the STEM students of today. CAMS is honored to form an alliance with M4 Engineering, and our continued collaboration<\/em>\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About M4 Engineering, Inc.:&nbsp;<\/strong>M4 Engineering helps develop new types of manned and unmanned space and flight vehicles. M4 Engineering based in Long Beach, CA was founded in 2001 by Dr. Myles L. Baker to help commercial companies and government agencies predict and optimize vehicle performance, with emphasis on providing Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) software and services. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About CAMS VEX Robotics:&nbsp;<\/strong>Has a thriving community of students, parents, and teachers involved. Students learn about mechanical and electrical systems, documenting the engineering design process, and computer programming. Students also develop career readiness skills such as collaboration, communication, and creativity. CAMS students also mentor local middle school VEX teams and hold a summer enrichment program to introduce the joys of VEX robotics to middle and elementary school students\n\n<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Long Beach, CA, 10\/31\/18 \u2013 M4 Engineering Inc., a leading Aerospace Engineering firm in the field of conceptual aircraft design, analysis and development is proud to announce its renewed commitment to California Academy of Math and Science (CAMS) and the talented 70+ students of the Vex Robotics Club.
