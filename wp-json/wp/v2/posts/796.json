SciTech is produced by&nbsp;<strong>The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)<\/strong>&nbsp;and is the world\u2019s largest technical society dedicated to the global aerospace profession.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>M4 Engineering has developed the WT-DCRPT software package to solve the challenge of accurately measuring unsteady aerodynamic loads. The underlying technology involves developing a measurement system based on identification of the structural dynamic behavior of the CTS structure for use in determining the applied dynamic forces based on measurements taken on the flexible balance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WT-DCRPT is used by the engineer to develop dynamic mathematical models of the wind tunnel vehicle model and CTS system and then use these models in estimating the dynamic forces from the wind tunnel experiment. The WT-DCRPT software has been successfully applied to measurement of unsteady loading of a GBU-38 store in the vicinity of a B-52 aircraft.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>M4 Engineering is working with AEDC and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.triumphgroup.com\/\">Triumph Aerospace Systems<\/a>&nbsp;to incorporate our dynamic system into current internal balance designs. While store trajectory simulation provided the initial motivating example, the developed dynamic balances can be used to significantly improve the results from wind tunnel experiments of any vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While attending the event, please visit the Triumph Aerospace booth for a complete demonstration of WT-DCRPT and meet the M4 Engineering team or read more about the software here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about SciTech 2014, go&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.aiaa.org\/default.aspx\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LONG BEACH, CA (January 9, 2014)&nbsp;M4 Engineering, which combines state-of-the-art software development with expertise in multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO), will announce its new Wind Tunnel Data Correction and Processing Software (WT-DCRPT ) at&nbsp;SciTech 2014 \u2013 AIAA Science and Technology Forum and Exposition&nbsp;in Maryland, January 13 \u2013 17, 2014.
