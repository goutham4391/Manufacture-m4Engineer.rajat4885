The IHAT system provided an ideal foundation for developing the proposed analysis system. The fact that the IHAT system already existed significantly reduced the risk of the proposed effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"440\" height=\"335\" src=\"https:\/\/m4-engineering.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/China_Lake_Figure-8-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-937\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.m4-engineering.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/China_Lake_Figure-8-1.jpg 440w, https:\/\/www.m4-engineering.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/China_Lake_Figure-8-1-300x228.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n\u201cThe Integrated Hypersonic Aeromechanics Tool (IHAT) has evolved into a viable product for the DOD community&#8221;, said Michael J.
