Work to date has included characterization of the significant challenges currently impeding dynamic load measurement. M4 Engineering has demonstrated a prototype unsteady load measurement system that determined applied loads based on measurements taken from the end of a flexible sting. The proposed effort will develop this technology further, including wind tunnel demonstration. The proposed development will create an excellent compliment to modern test and analysis methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program is a highly competitive three-phase award system that provides qualified small business concerns with opportunities to propose innovative ideas that meet the specific research and development needs of the federal government.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2> <br><strong>About M4 Engineering<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2001, M4 Engineering is a collective of aerospace and structural engineers who provide crisis and preventive engineering analysis, research and development consultation. As we like to say, we\u2019re the engineers to call before it breaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We combine state-of-the-art software development with expertise in multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO).
