<p>Historically NASA Langley Research Center has focused primarily on aeronautical research, and has also tested space hardware at the facility, such as the Apollo Lunar Module. But when it needed some support on developing an HFMDO framework, it knocked on M4 Engineering&#8217;s door.</p>



<p>CHALLENGES</p>



<ul><li>Diverse discipline specific requirements</li><li>Mapping across domains</li><li>Requirement to support multiple codes within discipline</li><li>Optimization across broad design spaces</li></ul>



<p>VALUE CREATED</p>



<ul><li>Accurate modeling of inter-disciplinary couplings</li><li>Prediction of the performance</li><li>Evaluation of the benefits and risks</li><li>Quickly integrate FEA/CFD analysis, morph geometry, re-mesh and apply loads</li></ul>



<p>This Nasa Research Announcement (NRA) under prime contract number NNL08AA00C for NASA Langley awarded to M4 Engineering delivers physics-based multidisciplinary analysis and design optimization (MDAO) capabilities that are required to develop next generation supersonic fixed wing aircraft. The software tools and approaches upgrade NASA’s capability for MDAO to the next level, through accurate modeling of interdisciplinary couplings, prediction of the performance, and evaluation of the benefits and risks.</p>



<p>In this work, M4 Engineering and Phoenix Integration combined their specialties to deliver a modular design environment through an enhanced ModelCenter framework that is suitable to high fidelity analysis and design of coupled systems. The integrated modules included Geometry, Aero, Propulsion, Structural, S&amp;C, Noise, and Mission as well as geometry morphing and automatic FEM generation.</p>



<p>ModelCenter was enhanced to transfer complex data between disciplines using user-defined custom data types. Common data object libraries were developed based on the custom data types, such as distributed aerodynamics database and finite element deflection field to support high-fidelity aerodynamics and structural analyses.</p>



<p>Advanced parametric geometry and grid technology developed by M4 Engineering was upgraded and integrated into ModelCenter so that engineers can quickly integrate FEA/CFD analysis, morph geometry, re-mesh, and apply loads to optimize the aircraft configurations. Several example applications were created to demonstrate applying developed capabilities to optimization of fixed wing supersonic design problems. The data objects and integrated tools created are available as reusable modules in the object-oriented framework environment.</p>



<p>The process to analyze a supersonic configuration is shown in Design Structure Matrix format, Figure 30-1 in which the inputs to a module are shown in the same column as the module, and the outputs are shown on the same row (with the exception of the far left column, which represents overall process inputs)</p>

<p><strong>Long Beach, CA, 9/28/18– M4 Engineering Inc.</strong>, a leading Aerospace Engineering firm in the field of conceptual aircraft design, analysis and development received a $518,789 grant on August, 24th 2018. The contract was issued by NASA for the purpose of continued development of Physics-Based Weight Prediction software, M4 Structures Studio (formerly PBWeight).</p>



<p>The goal of the project is to extend the M4 Structures Studio (M4SS) software to support rotorcraft and eVTOL features and applications. Funding was allocated to pursue the following tasks:</p>



<p>1) A suite of rotorcraft features will be developed to support the analysis of a variety of configurations.</p>



<p>2) Develop functionality to support automated workflows within an MDAO framework.</p>



<p>3) Six unique demonstration applications showcasing different capabilities developed during the Phase III.</p>



<p>4) Various updates will be made to the software package to improve speed and accuracy.</p>



<p>The principal investigator for this effort will be Tyler Winter, Manager of Research and Development at M4.</p>



<p>Dr. Myles L. Baker, President, M4 Engineering commented on this award: “We are excited to continue working with NASA to develop tools and technologies that will enable the next generation of aircraft configurations. Using the physics-based approach taken in M4SS allows users to predict the weight and apply this to new kinds of vehicles. It really improves the way things are currently done.”</p>



<p>This is especially important in this aviation renaissance, as recent advances in electric propulsion make it possible to design totally new types of aircraft, where previous methods used don’t apply very well. With the large and rapid influx of emerging UAM concepts, NASA continues to advance the state-of-the-art in aerospace conceptual design by investing in technology to accelerate the structural analysis and weight prediction process.</p>



<p>“It is a such an exciting and timely opportunity to expand M4 Structures Studio’s analysis capability and broaden the application domain to include rotorcraft and eVTOL configurations”, added Tyler Winter.</p>

<p>BY VERTICAL MAGAZINE / STAFF WRITER</p>



<p>Uber kicks off its second Elevate Summit by officially sharing the design specifications for its electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOL) common reference model.</p>



<p>Uber’s eVTOL common reference models (eCRM) represent a new class of aircraft, that utilize distributed electric propulsion, which was spearheaded by 30-year NASA veteran, and now Uber’s director of aviation engineering, Mark Moore.</p>



<p>Uber’s eCRMs are designed for safe transition between vertical and forward flight, which is achieved through stacked co-rotating propellers. Stacked co-rotating rotors or propellers have two rotor systems placed on top of each other rotating in the same direction. Initial experimentation of this concept has revealed the potential for significantly quieter performance than traditional paired rotors and improved overall performance.</p>



<p>…</p>



<p>“We are exceptionally excited to be working with Uber to help change the way the world moves,” said&nbsp;Myles Baker, M4 Aerospace Engineering’s CEO. “We have been working in the aviation industry for many years, and it is great to see the right pieces come together to do something so transformational.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verticalmag.com/press-releases/uber-releases-evtol-concepts-advance-technologys-safety-noise-characteristics/">Read more.</a></p>

<p>BY GRAHAM WARWICK /&nbsp; AVIATION WEEK &amp; SPACE TECHNOLOGY</p>



<p>How do you create a new form of aviation? By collaborating, Uber contends. To realize its Elevate vision of urban air transport, the ride-hailing giant has assembled a phalanx of partners across the entire ecosystem from vehicles to vertiports.</p>



<p>Uber is also investing in internal teams to tackle what it sees as key gaps in industry’s ability to build ride-sharing networks of electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) air taxis within cities, including noise, batteries, airspace and infrastructure.</p>



<p>At its second Elevate Summit in Los Angeles on May 8-9, Uber is assembling the entire urban air mobility (UAM) ecosystem and unveiling models and tools it is developing to help industry design new classes of aircraft with which it has no experience.</p>



<p>“Manufacturers know how to produce aircraft, but none have developed an eVTOL for urban air mobility,” says Rob McDonald, Uber’s head of vehicle engineering. “We look for gaps in technology, tools and testing and spend money to fill those gaps and share the results with our partners.”</p>



<p>…</p>



<p>These tools are dedicated to the design of the partners’ vehicles, which cannot be shown, and the eCRMs are a way to showcase the results without giving away proprietary designs. This is part of Uber’s strategy to share information as widely as possible to advance the art of eVTOL design across industry.</p>



<p>Already, M4 Aerospace Engineering has applied Uber’s eCRMs to developing weight-prediction methods for some of the most unique features of eVTOLs. Georgia Tech has used these concepts to perform analyses to compare and contrast the safety of different concept approaches.&nbsp;<a href="https://aviationweek.com/future-aerospace/uber-advances-evtol-design-common-reference-concepts">Read more.</a></p>

<p><strong>NEW SOLUTION PROVIDES A SEA</strong><strong>MLESS PROCESS AND GREAT OPTIMIZATION&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>RESULTS</strong></p>



<p>In the first build of the Integrated Hypersonic Aeromechanics Tool (IHAT), the fundamental disciplines of Propulsion, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Thermal Analysis were integrated into a seamless process that simulated the overall performance of a high speed missile. The design structure matrix for Build 4 of the IHAT system shows the connections between the different analysis modules, including Geometry, Aero, Propulsion, Trajectory, Thermal, Structural, Stability &amp; Control, Sensors, Lethality, and Cost.</p>



<p><strong>OPTIMIZED STRATEGY</strong></p>



<p>A hierarchical optimization strategy was implemented in IHAT, where structural thicknesses and ply angles were optimized in the Structures Module, and insulation thicknesses were optimized in the Thermal Module. The IHAT system provided an ideal foundation for developing the proposed analysis system. The fact that the IHAT system already existed significantly reduced the risk of the proposed effort.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="440" height="335" src="https://m4-engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/China_Lake_Figure-8-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-937" srcset="https://www.m4-engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/China_Lake_Figure-8-1.jpg 440w, https://www.m4-engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/China_Lake_Figure-8-1-300x228.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></figure>



<p>

<h1>FSU wind tunnel marks new era</h1>



<p></p>



<p>Aerospace engineering research in Tallahassee entered the supersonic range Monday with the unveiling of a wind tunnel at Innovation Park that is the “crown jewel” of the Florida Center for Advanced Aero-Propulsion.</p>



<p>Housed in its own specially designed room in FSU’s Aero-Propulsion, Mechatronics and Energy Building, the new polysonic wind tunnel is capable of speeds from Mach 0.2 to 5 — up to five times the speed of sound.</p>



<p>Five years in the making, the building and its facilities provide a testing platform for aircraft and aerospace companies to do research on new designs and to solve some of the problems they encounter in producing quieter, more efficient jets. Some have already signed research agreements for the testing they need and more work is on the way, said associate professor Rajan Kumar. Looking ahead, “the facility is going to be continuously busy.”</p>



<blockquote style="text-align:left" class="wp-block-quote"><p> <br><strong><em>“The first test we are going to do is for the Air Force along with the help of&nbsp;</em>M4 Engineering<em>&nbsp;– a company in California.” –&nbsp;Florida State University Associate Professor, Dr. Rajan Kumar</em></strong> </p></blockquote>



<p style="text-align:left">At the same time, students have the opportunity to perfect their research skills and expand the talent base needed to support Florida’s aviation and aerospace industry, which ranks fourth largest in the U.S. According to Enterprise Florida, the industry employs some 83,000 Floridians at more than 1,800 companies, with a total annual payroll of nearly $5 billion.</p>

<p><strong>LONG BEACH, CA (January 9, 2014)&nbsp;</strong>M4 Engineering, which combines state-of-the-art software development with expertise in multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO), will announce its new Wind Tunnel Data Correction and Processing Software (WT-DCRPT ) at&nbsp;<strong>SciTech 2014 – AIAA Science and Technology Forum and Exposition</strong>&nbsp;in Maryland, January 13 – 17, 2014. SciTech is produced by&nbsp;<strong>The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)</strong>&nbsp;and is the world’s largest technical society dedicated to the global aerospace profession.</p>



<p>M4 Engineering has developed the WT-DCRPT software package to solve the challenge of accurately measuring unsteady aerodynamic loads. The underlying technology involves developing a measurement system based on identification of the structural dynamic behavior of the CTS structure for use in determining the applied dynamic forces based on measurements taken on the flexible balance.</p>



<p>WT-DCRPT is used by the engineer to develop dynamic mathematical models of the wind tunnel vehicle model and CTS system and then use these models in estimating the dynamic forces from the wind tunnel experiment. The WT-DCRPT software has been successfully applied to measurement of unsteady loading of a GBU-38 store in the vicinity of a B-52 aircraft.</p>



<p>M4 Engineering is working with AEDC and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.triumphgroup.com/">Triumph Aerospace Systems</a>&nbsp;to incorporate our dynamic system into current internal balance designs. While store trajectory simulation provided the initial motivating example, the developed dynamic balances can be used to significantly improve the results from wind tunnel experiments of any vehicle.</p>



<p>While attending the event, please visit the Triumph Aerospace booth for a complete demonstration of WT-DCRPT and meet the M4 Engineering team or read more about the software here.</p>

<p>

M4 Engineering has been selected by the DoD SBIR program for two Phase I awards.&nbsp; The topics are:

</p>



<ul><li>AF131-005&nbsp;Innovative Propeller Multi-Point Multi-Disciplinary Optimization</li></ul>



<p>

This proposal effort seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of developing and integrating a set of analysis modules into a multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) process in order to enhance propeller design and efficiency across a range of multi-point flight conditions.&nbsp; Emphasis will be placed on defining the interdisciplinary interactions and corresponding effects on overall propeller efficiency.&nbsp; Next, each of the analysis modules will be validated against simulated or experimental data.&nbsp; A modern propeller configuration will be selected as the base demonstration application and will be optimized and assessed against current state-of-the-art propeller performance. &nbsp;Lastly, the software developed within this effort will leverage M4 Engineering’s significant experience with MDAO as well as several robust, open-source tools.

</p>



<ul><li>AF131-003&nbsp;Evaluation of Unsteady Loads on Store Trajectories</li></ul>



<p>M4 Engineering proposes to develop methods for rapidly identifying store/aircraft configurations at elevated risk for adverse separation events.&nbsp; The methods developed will require from the user only data that is typically available prior to detailed influence load collection.&nbsp; One of the approaches will make use of independent parametric information for the store, bay, and ejector. enhance the Phase I method for predicting store trajectory response subject to unsteady aerodynamic loads.&nbsp; The techniques developed in this effort will complement existing methods by prioritizing cases for investigation with more computationally expensive test and analysis methods.</p>



<h2></h2>



<p>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is a highly competitive program that encourages domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/R&amp;D) that has the potential for commercialization. Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR enables small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. By including qualified small businesses in the nation’s R&amp;D arena, high-tech innovation is stimulated and the United States gains entrepreneurial spirit as it meets its specific research and development needs.</p>
