NASA Spinoff is a government publication that covers how NASA technologies can be utilized in commercial products.</p><p>Since the early 2000s, the core algorithms of M4SS have been under development. These algorithms have recently been utilized by NASA engineers at Ames, Armstrong, Glenn, and Langley Research Centers for modeling and analyzing unconventional aircraft. In 2014, M4SS became available commercially. A wide range of startups and established companies now use the software to design rotorcraft, rotary-wing aircraft like helicopters, and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles such as flying cars. One of M4’s more prominent clients is Uber, which is using M4SS to design urban air taxis. Another M4 client is DisRaptor, a Toronto-based vehicle developer that is using M4SS to design a “drive and fly sporty vehicle” that can be parked in a garage.</p><p><strong>How M4SS Works</strong></p><p>M4SS has four steps:</p><ol><li>Create an initial computerized model of the design through integration with the open-source NASA code Open Vehicle Sketchpad (OpenVSP)</li><li>Identify structural hardpoints, locations on the airframe designed to carry an external or internal load on the model, such as the engine or landing gear</li><li>Generate a visualization of the internal structural layout of the design with all the necessary structural detail</li><li>Estimate the total weight of the vehicle and provide breakdowns of weight for customizable subsets of components</li></ol><p>M4SS generates structural analysis files written in NASA Structural Analysis (NASTRAN), a NASA source code developed in the late 1960s. NASTRAN utilizes the finite element method (FEM), which solves a large problem by subdividing the model into small, simple parts called finite elements. In a conventional aircraft, finite elements include an aircraft’s primary structures, such as the wings, tail and fuselage—the body of the airplane.</p><p>Multiple languages are used to code M4SS, including Python, C++ and Fortran, said Myles Baker, CEO of M4, and Tyler Winter, manager of research and development at M4.</p><p>Baker and Winter said ongoing refinements of M4SS include enhancement and support for vehicle loads modeling for rotorcraft, user interface improvements, code performance improvements, and support for additional platforms, including macOS and Linux.</p><p>M4 is also working on a variation of M4SS for universities called M4 Structures Studio Academic Program.</p><p>“We are currently working with multiple professors on developing a way to integrate it into their curricula. [We are] exploring options of bundling it with a finite element method solver to make it easier to deploy. Our first official academic launch is anticipated next year,” said Baker and Winter.</p><p>Winter and Baker said clients are currently using M4SS to design supersonic commercial transport aircraft, which are transport planes that fly faster than the speed of sound, reusable launch vehicles, subsonic unconventional transport aircraft, urban air mobility vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles like drones, and rotorcraft.</p><p><strong>The History Behind M4SS</strong></p><p>M4 engineers began developing the core algorithms for M4SS, first known as RapidFEM, based on their experience in resolving difficulties with modeling structures and predicting the weight of supersonic airliners, large passenger aircraft that travel faster than the speed of sound. Since the early 2000s, NASA has awarded approximately $2 million in Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and non-SBIR awards to help develop M4SS.</p><p>The agency’s early funding focused on developing M4SS to design fixed-wing aircraft. Later, NASA’s Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology project helped M4 write code for eVTOL vehicles. Over the past six years, approximately 20 M4 employees have worked on M4SS.</p><p>Winter and Baker said M4 clients have helped improve the software by offering suggestions about the capabilities of the program’s streamlining of structural analysis model generation, sizing, and weight estimation process for unconventional aircraft configurations.</p><p>“When we work with our beta testers, we pay special attention to their feedback as a way to continuously improve the user experience and the software’s performance. While we talk about [M4SS] being used for weight estimation, that quick weight estimation is based on a lot of physics calculations. [These calculations] also tell you if the design is feasible or not, and &#8230; help guide the design process &#8230; by identifying structural problems early,” said Winter and Baker.</p>					</div>

What you imagine is probably what most commercial airliners look like, a design that has been improved and tweaked—but not really overhauled—for decades.</p><p>Modern airliners work well at carrying dozens or even hundreds of passengers from airport to airport. But what if you’re designing an aircraft for a different purpose and want something smaller, that doesn’t need a runway? Something that could carry a few people from their office to a restaurant across town?</p><p>These aircraft may not look like what you’re used to. But open the universe of design concepts, and you also open a universe of uncertainty: How will it fly? Is it strong enough? Are the batteries big enough? How much fuel will it need?</p><p>Getting quick answers to these questions is relatively easy when designing a new variation of a tried and true aircraft. If it’s like a 737 but 15 percent bigger, then you can use mathematical formulas to determine what that will likely mean for other characteristics.</p><p>“For aircraft within our scope of knowledge and experience, we can probably estimate within 5 percent what the empty weight of that aircraft would be at conceptual design,” says Chris Silva, a research engineer in the aeromechanics branch at Ames Research Center.</p><p>But with an entirely new concept, that’s much harder. For those, “there have historically been pretty big error bars on how well we can lock down the numbers we come up with in conceptual design,” Silva says.</p><p>It may seem like a small detail, but weight has ramifications for many aspects of how an aircraft will look and ultimately fly. For one thing, heavier aircraft require more fuel, which in turn adds to the weight. Weight puts more stress on structures, which then might require thicker or stronger materials. And in the worst case, these factors all circle around endlessly until the aircraft is too heavy to get off the ground.</p><p>There are ways to make decent weight estimates on conceptual designs, but these methods tend to take a long time and a lot of work, Silva explains. “We wanted to come up with something that’s both credible and pretty fast, because we like to be able to look at several things in succession,” since the results can help inform decisions about how best to refine the design.</p><p><strong>Technology Transfer</strong></p><p>That’s where M4 Engineering Inc., based in Long Beach, California, came in. The company had already been working on M4 Structures Studio, software that estimates weight for conceptual aircraft designs, when Silva came across them—and NASA was already heavily involved.</p><p>Not only had the company received two NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts to fund early stages of the development, but the program integrates open source NASA code, Open Vehicle Sketchpad (Open VSP), to generate the initial computer model of the design, and another NASA spinoff code, NASTRAN, to analyze the optimization-ready structural analysis model created in M4 Structures Studio.</p><p>Although both those tools were already good, M4 Engineering added extra features to make them work even better for their purposes. For example, says Tyler Winter, the company’s research and development manager for technology and projects, they added a plug-in to OpenVSP to lay out what they call structural hard points—places on the structure where you might attach something heavy, like an engine or landing gear.</p><p>With help from NASA funding, M4 Engineering also built its Sketch Editor, which combines the initial model developed in Open VSP with the structural hard points created in the plug-in and other inputs, and creates a visualization of the internal structural layout. It also allows the engineer to provide all of the necessary structural detail to rapidly generate an optimization-ready structural analysis model.</p><p>This model feeds into NASTRAN, he says, which in turn generates the inputs needed to run the weight statement generator. The weight statement gives the total estimated weight of the vehicle and breakdowns for the weight of structural and non-structural components, as well as more fine-tuned weights for different parts of the vehicle. The user can also customize the report, Winter says, for example, if they want to know the weight of a specific subset of components.</p><p>The early NASA funding focused on developing M4 Structures Studio for fixed-wing aircraft, but the NASA Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology project funded a Phase III SBIR contract to extend the software to vertical takeoff vehicles.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><p>One of the biggest benefits with M4 Structures Studio is speed, explains Myles Baker, M4 Engineering’s president. “When we were doing it manually, it was something on the order of six months to go through the physics calculations to get the weight of the airplane,” he recalls.</p><p>But with M4 Structures Studio, the process shrinks to just weeks or even hours. “Especially in the early phases of a program, where you’re updating things constantly—stretching the wing, stretching the fuselage—to figure out a combination that works, turning those iterations is enormously faster.”</p><p>He says this can change the entire workflow for design engineers. In the past, they might make their best attempt at a first design, do the analysis, and make improvements, and then repeat that process two or three times over the next year or so, “and hopefully you get something that’s good enough, or it gets cancelled.”</p><p>But with M4 Structures Studio, the feedback comes right away, especially once the initial models are completed. That means “the number of designs you can explore is much larger, and the chances of finding a design that really works is much higher,” Baker emphasizes.</p><p>Today, M4 Engineering offers the software package as a stand-alone product, but the company also uses it in-house for its consulting business. They are also looking to put out an academic version for engineering programs at universities and even high schools.</p><p>Uber is also a client. The ride-sharing company is using custom M4 Engineering software—developed with expertise created for Structures Studio and including many of the same components—in its Uber Elevate program, which aims to create a system of urban air taxis based largely on electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles. “We’re working with Uber to analyze Uber’s common reference models, such as Tilt Rotor or Tilt Wing eVTOL vehicles, and develop weight prediction methods that apply to some of the most unique features of this new class of eVTOL vehicles that Uber’s Partners and network will support,” explains Dan Abir, M4 Engineering’s director of sales and marketing.</p><p>Other customers are working on new designs for supersonic jets, the fast-changing drone industry, and high-altitude platform station aircraft, which are essentially high-altitude gliders, Abir says, most often powered with solar or hybrid energy. These fly lower than satellites but can serve similar functions, for example in relaying communications signals.</p><p>Outside of the aeronautics sector, Abir says they have done some work in designing new submarines and even wind turbines. And they are even exploring work with companies interested in designing flying cars—which, unlike Uber’s air taxis, would be hybrid vehicles, able to drive on the ground as well as take off vertically and fly.</p><p>Abir says it’s exciting to see the diverse ways this software is helping create a new air mobility landscape. “We’re living in the age of the Jetsons,” he says, and with NASA’s help, companies like M4 Engineering are helping lead the way into the future.</p>					</div>

<p>BY VERTICAL MAGAZINE / STAFF WRITER</p>



<p>Uber kicks off its second Elevate Summit by officially sharing the design specifications for its electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOL) common reference model.</p>



<p>Uber’s eVTOL common reference models (eCRM) represent a new class of aircraft, that utilize distributed electric propulsion, which was spearheaded by 30-year NASA veteran, and now Uber’s director of aviation engineering, Mark Moore.</p>



<p>Uber’s eCRMs are designed for safe transition between vertical and forward flight, which is achieved through stacked co-rotating propellers. Stacked co-rotating rotors or propellers have two rotor systems placed on top of each other rotating in the same direction. Initial experimentation of this concept has revealed the potential for significantly quieter performance than traditional paired rotors and improved overall performance.</p>

<p>BY GRAHAM WARWICK /&nbsp; AVIATION WEEK &amp; SPACE TECHNOLOGY</p>



<p>How do you create a new form of aviation? By collaborating, Uber contends. To realize its Elevate vision of urban air transport, the ride-hailing giant has assembled a phalanx of partners across the entire ecosystem from vehicles to vertiports.</p>



<p>Uber is also investing in internal teams to tackle what it sees as key gaps in industry’s ability to build ride-sharing networks of electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) air taxis within cities, including noise, batteries, airspace and infrastructure.</p>



<p>At its second Elevate Summit in Los Angeles on May 8-9, Uber is assembling the entire urban air mobility (UAM) ecosystem and unveiling models and tools it is developing to help industry design new classes of aircraft with which it has no experience.</p>



<p>“Manufacturers know how to produce aircraft, but none have developed an eVTOL for urban air mobility,” says Rob McDonald, Uber’s head of vehicle engineering. “We look for gaps in technology, tools and testing and spend money to fill those gaps and share the results with our partners.”</p>



<p>…</p>



<p>These tools are dedicated to the design of the partners’ vehicles, which cannot be shown, and the eCRMs are a way to showcase the results without giving away proprietary designs. This is part of Uber’s strategy to share information as widely as possible to advance the art of eVTOL design across industry.</p>



<p>Already, M4 Aerospace Engineering has applied Uber’s eCRMs to developing weight-prediction methods for some of the most unique features of eVTOLs. Georgia Tech has used these concepts to perform analyses to compare and contrast the safety of different concept approaches.&nbsp;<a href="https://aviationweek.com/future-aerospace/uber-advances-evtol-design-common-reference-concepts">Read more.</a></p>

<p>He was interrupted by a telephone call from a facilities manager at Cal State Fullerton who wanted Rotty to turn on all of the campus’ 500 outdoor lighting fixtures to full brightness – quickly. Some were dim, others off. Police needed the campus to be lit up as if it were daytime.</p>



<p>They were searching for jewel thieves who had made an armed heist at a Moreno Valley pawn shop.

<h1>FSU wind tunnel marks new era</h1>



<p></p>



<p>Aerospace engineering research in Tallahassee entered the supersonic range Monday with the unveiling of a wind tunnel at Innovation Park that is the “crown jewel” of the Florida Center for Advanced Aero-Propulsion.</p>



<p>Housed in its own specially designed room in FSU’s Aero-Propulsion, Mechatronics and Energy Building, the new polysonic wind tunnel is capable of speeds from Mach 0.2 to 5 — up to five times the speed of sound.</p>



<p>Five years in the making, the building and its facilities provide a testing platform for aircraft and aerospace companies to do research on new designs and to solve some of the problems they encounter in producing quieter, more efficient jets. Some have already signed research agreements for the testing they need and more work is on the way, said associate professor Rajan Kumar. Looking ahead, “the facility is going to be continuously busy.”</p>



<blockquote style="text-align:left" class="wp-block-quote"><p> <br><strong><em>“The first test we are going to do is for the Air Force along with the help of&nbsp;</em>M4 Engineering<em>&nbsp;– a company in California.” –&nbsp;Florida State University Associate Professor, Dr. Rajan Kumar</em></strong> </p></blockquote>



<p style="text-align:left">At the same time, students have the opportunity to perfect their research skills and expand the talent base needed to support Florida’s aviation and aerospace industry, which ranks fourth largest in the U.S. According to Enterprise Florida, the industry employs some 83,000 Floridians at more than 1,800 companies, with a total annual payroll of nearly $5 billion.</p>

<p>By Cyndia Zwahlen for the Los Angeles Times</p>



<p>May 2, 2011</p>



<p>M4 Engineering Inc., a small company in Long Beach, has figured out how to use tax dollars to prosper.</p>



<p>Not its tax dollars. The company — which provides structural analysis, consulting and software development for aerospace firms — has leveraged a string of federal research grants into products and services it sells to clients.</p>



<p>t has even spun off a small company, Modular Wind Energy Inc. of Huntington Beach, which uses M4’s federally funded research to develop lighter and cheaper blades for wind turbines.</p>



<p>“What we have tried to do is take that money from the government and, sure, do good research for the problem the government is interested in, but also try to turn that into something much bigger, said Kevin Roughen, M4’s vice president.</p>



<p>M4, which has 20 employees, was started with the help of a federal grant in 2001.</p>



<p>Turning research into commercial products is a main goal of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. The federal programs spend about $2 billion a year on grants and contracts for scientific research and development.</p>



<p>SBIR was established by law in 1982 to fund high-tech research at small businesses. STTR, a smaller program that requires a university research partner, began in 1992.</p>



<p>California typically wins the largest chunk of money from the programs. Small businesses in the state won $402 million through 1,230 grants and contracts awarded in the government’s fiscal 2009, according to the Small Business Administration’s Technology Resources Network.</p>



<p>Auritec Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Santa Monica said that without grants, it wouldn’t have been able to fund data collection for the drug delivery method it developed.</p>



<p>“We are starting to talk to big pharmaceutical companies about licensing our products,” said Amanda Malone, vice president of Auritec, which has 15 employees. “If we didn’t have that data, I don’t think anybody would be talking to us, and you can’t get that kind of data without money.”</p>



<p>But the future of SBIR and STTR is uncertain. Not formally reauthorized by Congress for several years, they’ve been limping along on extensions.</p>



<p>“It is nerve-racking,” said Rick Shie, senior vice president of Physical Optics Corp. in Torrance, a frequent SBIR grant winner that develops and makes optical electronics for military and commercial use. Started 25 years ago under an SBIR grant, the firm now employs 180 people and has spun off six other companies.</p>



<p>Part of the holdup in reauthorization is because of a battle over how much of the funds can go to venture capital-backed businesses. A House version of a funding bill would allow 35% to 45% of SBIR awards to go to businesses that are majority-owned by venture capitalists. The Senate version allows 15% to 25%.</p>



<p>Although most of the individual grants are relatively small — starting at about $150,000 for so-called Phase I awards — companies can apply for more than one at a time. Phase II awards, which are harder to get, can reach about $1 million.</p>



<p>Not all businesses have been happy with the programs. A frequently heard complaint is that the grant process takes too long.</p>



<p>Also, there have been concerns about the potential for fraud — an SBIR program overseen byNASA was found, in an internal review, to not have “appropriate internal controls.” The review found that this left the door open to grant recipients receiving multiple awards for the same research, or making claims for costs that were not allowed.</p>



<p>The SBA is working on a set of initiatives to try to fix some of the security shortcomings.</p>



<p>At their best, the programs provide small businesses with the chance to work on high-risk research that can produce big rewards.</p>



<p>“We own our own soul, and that’s the point, because of SBIR you don’t have to sell your soul” to outside investors, Shie said. “And you can retain your technology.”</p>
