				<p><strong>Long Beach, CA, 5/5/20</strong>–<strong> M4 Engineering Inc.</strong>, a leading Aerospace Engineering firm in the field of conceptual aircraft design, analysis, and development received recognition in an <a href="https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2020/t_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article from NASA <em>Spinoff</em></a>, NASA’s premier technology publication, for the development of aircraft optimization software.  This NASA funded software, <a href="https://www.m4-engineering.com/m4ss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M4 Structures Studio</a> (M4SS), enables users to estimate aircraft weight and create optimal designs accurately and efficiently, greatly reducing the time and effort needed for appropriate aircraft weight estimations.</p><p>Chris Silva, a research engineer in the aeromechanics branch at Ames Research center, noted the difficulties he encountered with accurate weight approximations before his branch acquired M4SS, stating: “There have historically been pretty big error bars on how well we can lock down the numbers we come up with in conceptual design.”</p><p>Silva commented, “We wanted to come up with something that’s both credible and pretty fast, because we like to be able to look at several things in succession.”  In response, M4 Engineering revolutionized the procedures for estimating weight on conceptual aircraft designs with<a href="https://www.m4-engineering.com/m4ss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> M4 Structures Studio</a>.  M4SS streamlines this process by allowing users to:</p><ol><li>Create an initial computerized model of the design through integration with the open source NASA code, Open Vehicle Sketchpad.</li><li>Identify structural hard points on the model, such as an engine or landing gear.</li><li>Generate a visualization of the internal structural layout of the design with all necessary structural detail.</li><li>Estimate the total weight of the vehicle and provide the breakdowns of weight for customizable subsets of components.</li></ol><p>The principal investigator for this effort was Tyler Winter, Manager of Research and Development at M4.                 </p><p>Dr. Myles L. Baker, President, M4 Engineering commented on the ability of the software: “Especially in the early phases of a program, when you’re updating this constantly—stretching the wing, stretching the fuselage—to figure out a combination that works, turning those iterations is enormously faster.”</p><p>In the past, manual computations of aircraft weight often took up to six months for a single model.  However, <a href="https://www.m4-engineering.com/m4ss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M4 Structures Studio</a> has significantly refined the process for weight estimation of conceptual aircraft designs. With M4SS, engineers have the ability to receive weight-related feedback as soon as the initial models are completed, shrinking the procedure for weight calculation to weeks or even hours.</p><p>“The number of designs you can explore is much larger, and the chances of finding a design that really works is much higher,” Dr. Baker added.</p><p>Not only does M4 Engineering offer <a href="https://www.m4-engineering.com/m4ss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M4 Structures Studio</a> as a stand-alone product, but the company also utilizes the software in-house for its consulting business. Additionally, M4 Engineering is looking to adapt an academic version of the product which could be used in universities and high schools.</p><p><strong>About NASA<em> Spinoff</em>:</strong><em> </em><em>Spinof</em><em>f</em> is a NASA funded publication which highlights NASA technologies that are benefiting life on Earth in the form of commercial products.  About 50 spinoff technologies are featured annually in the publication, demonstrating the wider benefits of America’s investment in its space program.</p><p><span style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 600;">About M4 Engineering, Inc.: </span><span style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;">M4 Engineering focuses on solving the multitude of challenges that arise in the development of new types of manned and unmanned space and flight vehicles.

<p><strong>Long Beach, CA, 9/28/18– M4 Engineering Inc.</strong>, a leading Aerospace Engineering firm in the field of conceptual aircraft design, analysis and development received a $518,789 grant on August, 24th 2018. The contract was issued by NASA for the purpose of continued development of Physics-Based Weight Prediction software, M4 Structures Studio (formerly PBWeight).</p>



<p>The goal of the project is to extend the M4 Structures Studio (M4SS) software to support rotorcraft and eVTOL features and applications. Funding was allocated to pursue the following tasks:</p>



<p>1) A suite of rotorcraft features will be developed to support the analysis of a variety of configurations.</p>



<p>2) Develop functionality to support automated workflows within an MDAO framework.</p>



<p>3) Six unique demonstration applications showcasing different capabilities developed during the Phase III.</p>



<p>4) Various updates will be made to the software package to improve speed and accuracy.</p>



<p>The principal investigator for this effort will be Tyler Winter, Manager of Research and Development at M4.</p>



<p>Dr. Myles L. Baker, President, M4 Engineering commented on this award: “We are excited to continue working with NASA to develop tools and technologies that will enable the next generation of aircraft configurations. Using the physics-based approach taken in M4SS allows users to predict the weight and apply this to new kinds of vehicles. It really improves the way things are currently done.”</p>



<p>This is especially important in this aviation renaissance, as recent advances in electric propulsion make it possible to design totally new types of aircraft, where previous methods used don’t apply very well. With the large and rapid influx of emerging UAM concepts, NASA continues to advance the state-of-the-art in aerospace conceptual design by investing in technology to accelerate the structural analysis and weight prediction process.</p>



<p>“It is a such an exciting and timely opportunity to expand M4 Structures Studio’s analysis capability and broaden the application domain to include rotorcraft and eVTOL configurations”, added Tyler Winter.</p>

<p><strong>LONG BEACH, CA (January 9, 2014)&nbsp;</strong>M4 Engineering, which combines state-of-the-art software development with expertise in multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO), will announce its new Wind Tunnel Data Correction and Processing Software (WT-DCRPT ) at&nbsp;<strong>SciTech 2014 – AIAA Science and Technology Forum and Exposition</strong>&nbsp;in Maryland, January 13 – 17, 2014. SciTech is produced by&nbsp;<strong>The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)</strong>&nbsp;and is the world’s largest technical society dedicated to the global aerospace profession.</p>



<p>M4 Engineering has developed the WT-DCRPT software package to solve the challenge of accurately measuring unsteady aerodynamic loads. The underlying technology involves developing a measurement system based on identification of the structural dynamic behavior of the CTS structure for use in determining the applied dynamic forces based on measurements taken on the flexible balance.</p>



<p>WT-DCRPT is used by the engineer to develop dynamic mathematical models of the wind tunnel vehicle model and CTS system and then use these models in estimating the dynamic forces from the wind tunnel experiment. The WT-DCRPT software has been successfully applied to measurement of unsteady loading of a GBU-38 store in the vicinity of a B-52 aircraft.</p>



<p>M4 Engineering is working with AEDC and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.triumphgroup.com/">Triumph Aerospace Systems</a>&nbsp;to incorporate our dynamic system into current internal balance designs. While store trajectory simulation provided the initial motivating example, the developed dynamic balances can be used to significantly improve the results from wind tunnel experiments of any vehicle.</p>



<p>While attending the event, please visit the Triumph Aerospace booth for a complete demonstration of WT-DCRPT and meet the M4 Engineering team or read more about the software here.</p>

<p>

M4 Engineering has been selected by the DoD SBIR program for two Phase I awards.&nbsp; The topics are:

</p>



<ul><li>AF131-005&nbsp;Innovative Propeller Multi-Point Multi-Disciplinary Optimization</li></ul>



<p>

This proposal effort seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of developing and integrating a set of analysis modules into a multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) process in order to enhance propeller design and efficiency across a range of multi-point flight conditions.&nbsp; Emphasis will be placed on defining the interdisciplinary interactions and corresponding effects on overall propeller efficiency.&nbsp; Next, each of the analysis modules will be validated against simulated or experimental data.&nbsp; A modern propeller configuration will be selected as the base demonstration application and will be optimized and assessed against current state-of-the-art propeller performance. &nbsp;Lastly, the software developed within this effort will leverage M4 Engineering’s significant experience with MDAO as well as several robust, open-source tools.

</p>



<ul><li>AF131-003&nbsp;Evaluation of Unsteady Loads on Store Trajectories</li></ul>



<p>M4 Engineering proposes to develop methods for rapidly identifying store/aircraft configurations at elevated risk for adverse separation events.&nbsp; The methods developed will require from the user only data that is typically available prior to detailed influence load collection.&nbsp; One of the approaches will make use of independent parametric information for the store, bay, and ejector. enhance the Phase I method for predicting store trajectory response subject to unsteady aerodynamic loads.&nbsp; The techniques developed in this effort will complement existing methods by prioritizing cases for investigation with more computationally expensive test and analysis methods.</p>
